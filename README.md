RQDA-to-gephi

I am not particularly proud of this code but I hope I will be improving it. It started with the idea of plot a dataset that was tagged in RQDA (http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/) into gephi (http://gephi.github.io/), but it ended containing other features.

Right now is mainly code that you are free to use and modify. Don't hesitate to ask me how to use it, or send bug reports or ideas.
